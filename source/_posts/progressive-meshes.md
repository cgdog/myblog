**Progressive meshes** is one of the techniques of dynamic level of detail (LOD). This technique was introduced by Hugues Hoppe in 1996\. This method uses saving a model to the structure - the progressive mesh, which allows a smooth choice of detail levels depending on the current view. Practically, this means that it is possible to display whole model with the lowest level of detail at once and then it gradually shows even more details. Among the disadvantages belongs considerable memory consumption. The advantage is that it can work in real time. Progressive meshes could be used also in other areas of computer technology such as a gradual transfer of data through the Internet or compression.
