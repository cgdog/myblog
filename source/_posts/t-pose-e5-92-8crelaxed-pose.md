**T-pose(T姿势)**是传统的建模姿势(在创建一个人物character时)。T-pose：站直，双臂向两边伸开，最好肘部和膝盖有轻微的弯。这些年来，传统的T-pose已经被**放松姿势(relaxed pose)**所替代(为了好操作人物)，因为放松姿势更容易skinning，能更好地产生形变。

> 原文:

The T Pose is the traditional modeling pose when creating a character. The pose is standing straight, with arms extended out to the sides. A better version of this pose is to add a slight bend at the elbows and knees, as this helps the IK solver determined to the proper rotation angle in IK (called the preferred angle). Over the years, the traditional T pose has been replaced with the relaxed pose for rigging purposes, as the relaxed pose allows for easier skinning and better deformations.
