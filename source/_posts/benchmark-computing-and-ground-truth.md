# Benchmark

In computing, a **benchmark** is the act of running a computer program, a set of programs, or other operations, in order to assess the relative **performance** of an object, normally by running a number of standard tests and trials against it. The term **'benchmark'** is also mostly utilized for the purposes of elaborately designed **benchmarking programs** themselves.

**Benchmarking** is usually associated with assessing performance characteristics of computer hardware, for example, the floating point operation performance of a CPU, but there are circumstances when the technique is also applicable to software. Software benchmarks are, for example, run against compilers or database management systems.

Benchmarks provide a method of comparing the performance of various subsystems across different chip/system architectures.

# Ground truth

**Ground truth** is a term used in various fields to refer to information provided by **direct observation** as opposed to information provided by inference.

In **machine learning**, the term "**ground truth**" refers to the accuracy of the training set's classification for supervised learning techniques. This is used in statistical models to prove or disprove research hypotheses. The term "**ground truthing**" refers to the process of gathering the proper objective (provable) data for this test. Compare with gold standard.
